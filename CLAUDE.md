## Deployment

- The app runs on Railway, not on the local computer.
- Railway deploys the app automatically from the `main` branch of this GitHub repo.

## Database

- The database is a Railway PostgreSQL database.
- It is available only through the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable on Railway.

## Local environment

- Do not set up a local database.
- Do not set up or run a local server.

## Workflow

- Before every push, run `npm run build` to make sure the app builds. Do not push if the build fails.
- After each finished task, commit and push to GitHub so that Railway deploys the new version.
